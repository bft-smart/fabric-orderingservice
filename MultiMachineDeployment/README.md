This is a Byzantine fault-tolerant (BFT) ordering service for Hyperledger Fabric (HLF) v1.3. This BFT ordering service is a wrapper around BFT-SMaRt, a Java open source BFT library maintained by the LaSIGE research unit at the University of Lisbon.

To get started, check out the overview page and our quick start guide. You can also learn to compile the code. For a more in-dept look at how to configure a distributed deployment with this ordering service, you can read our guide.
