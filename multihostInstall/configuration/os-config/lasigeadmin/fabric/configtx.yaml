#   CAPABILITIES
#
#   This section defines the capabilities of fabric network. This is a new
#   concept as of v1.1.0 and should not be utilized in mixed networks with
#   v1.0.x peers and orderers.  Capabilities define features which must be
#   present in a fabric binary for that binary to safely participate in the
#   fabric network.  For instance, if a new MSP type is added, newer binaries
#   might recognize and validate the signatures from this type, while older
#   binaries without this support would be unable to validate those
#   transactions.  This could lead to different versions of the fabric binaries
#   having different world states.  Instead, defining a capability for a channel
#   informs those binaries without this capability that they must cease
#   processing transactions until they have been upgraded.  For v1.0.x if any
#   capabilities are defined (including a map with all capabilities turned off)
#   then the v1.0.x peer will deliberately crash.

    # Batch Timeout: The amount of time to wait before creating a batch.
    BatchTimeout: 2s

    # Batch Size: Controls the number of messages batched into a block.
    # The orderer views messages opaquely, but typically, messages may
    # be considered to be Fabric transactions.  The 'batch' is the group
    # of messages in the 'data' field of the block.  Blocks will be a few kb
    # larger than the batch size, when signatures, hashes, and other metadata
    # is applied.
    BatchSize:

        # Max Message Count: The maximum number of messages to permit in a
        # batch.  No block will contain more than this number of messages.
        MaxMessageCount: 10

        # Absolute Max Bytes: The absolute maximum number of bytes allowed for
        # the serialized messages in a batch. The maximum block size is this value
        # plus the size of the associated metadata (usually a few KB depending
        # upon the size of the signing identities). Any transaction larger than
        # this value will be rejected by ordering. If the "kafka" OrdererType is
        # selected, set 'message.max.bytes' and 'replica.fetch.max.bytes' on
        # the Kafka brokers to a value that is larger than this one.
        AbsoluteMaxBytes: 10 MB

        # Preferred Max Bytes: The preferred maximum number of bytes allowed
        # for the serialized messages in a batch. Roughly, this field may be considered
        # the best effort maximum size of a batch. A batch will fill with messages
        # until this size is reached (or the max message count, or batch timeout is
        # exceeded).  If adding a new message to the batch would cause the batch to
        # exceed the preferred max bytes, then the current batch is closed and written
        # to a block, and a new batch containing the new message is created.  If a
        # message larger than the preferred max bytes is received, then its batch
        # will contain only that message.  Because messages may be larger than
        # preferred max bytes (up to AbsoluteMaxBytes), some batches may exceed
        # the preferred max bytes, but will always contain exactly one transaction.
        PreferredMaxBytes: 512 KB

    # Max Channels is the maximum number of channels to allow on the ordering
    # network. When set to 0, this implies no maximum number of channels.
