# This file defines the replicas ids, IPs and ports.
# It is used by the replicas and clients to find connection info
# to the initial replicas.
# The ports defined here are the ports used by clients to communicate
# with the replicas. Additional connections are opened by replicas to
# communicate with each other. This additional connection is opened in the
# next port defined here. For an example, consider the line "0 127.0.0.1 11000".
# That means that clients will open a communication channel to replica 0 in
# IP 127.0.0.1 and port 11000. On startup, replicas with id different than 0
# will open a communication channel to replica 0 in port 11001.
# The same holds for replicas 1, 2, 3 ... N.

#server id, address and port (the ids from 0 to n-1 are the service replicas)
